* Why use Linux for a server?
- Linux is Free Software
  - Free to modify
  - Free to use with no restrictions
- Linux is extremely lightweight
- Linux can run with almost nothing on top of it

** Most importantly...
- Linux has a lot of software support for running web-servers
  - Apache
  - Nginx
** But what Linux are we going to be using for this workshop?
[[file:Images/Linux Distros.png]]
- There are many different flavors of Linux
- However today we are just going to focus on using [[https://ubuntu.com/#download][Ubuntu 20.04 LTS]]
* Why not Windows or Mac OS for a server?
- Windows and Mac OS are owned by parents companies that are restrictive with what you can do with them
- Windows and Mac have a lot of components that might be unnecessay for running just a web server on top
* One more advantage to running a Linux Web server:
- Linux is very lightweight, which makes it easy to *Virtualize*
* Why would we want to Virtualize our Web server?
- Hardware costs a lot of money
- With Virtualization solutions, we can run many seperate instances of Linux
  - So we can run many web-servers on just one computer
** What Virtualization Solution are we going to be using
- VMware Workstation Pro 16

- Virtual Box
- If you are using Apple M1 Silicon (A new Macbook): UTM should work
